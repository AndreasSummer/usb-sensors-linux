= Compile tempsensor from sources =

== Install required software ==

The 'build-essential' package is needed to be able to compile the source code.

{{{
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
}}}

== Download the source code and compile ==

This will download the latest version direct from trunk, this means that this is the version that is still under development and might not work as it should.

{{{
$ mkdir tempsensor
$ cd tempsensor
$ wget http://usb-sensors-linux.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tempsensor/tempsensor.c
}}}

Compile the source code

{{{
$ gcc -o tempsensor tempsensor.c -lusb-1.0
}}}

= Troubleshooting =

== Permission denied ==

If you get following issue when running tempsensor:

{{{
$ ./tempsensor 
libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/005: Permission denied.
}}}

It means that you have no access to the USB device, two solutions;

a) use sudo, eg "sudo ./tempsensor"

b) add line to udev to make the device writable

Create and edit following file:

{{{
$ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb.rules
}}}

Add following lines;

{{{
# Lascar 
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1781", ATTR{idProduct}=="0ec4", MODE="0666"
}}}

Save and reboot, now the device should be writable and give you results.
