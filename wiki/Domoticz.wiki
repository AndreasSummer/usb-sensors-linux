#summary How to send data from sensor to Domoticz

= Introduction =

Instructions how to send sensor data to the Domoticz application. Domoticz is a home automation system that can monitor different sensors via RFXtrx433 device, but it is also possible to send data via the web interface.

The only thing that is needed is a small bash script that collect the data, and send it to Domoticz with the curl utility.

= Send data from Tempsensor =

It is assumed that the tempsensor utility is installed and is working properly.

The bash script file:

{{{
#!/bin/sh

# Domoticz server
SERVER="a.b.c.d:8080"

# Get data
INDATA=`/home/user/tempsensor/tempsensor -s`
TEMP=`echo $INDATA | cut -d \, -f 1`
HUM=`echo $INDATA | cut -d \, -f 2`

# If TEMP/HUM contains value then send it to Domoticz
if [ -z "$TEMP" -a -z "$HUM" ];
then
	echo "$NOW - Error: Value variable empty"
else
        # Sensor parameters
        HID="1"
        DID="4000"
        DUNIT="4"
        DTYPE="82"
        DSUBTYPE="1"
        NVALUE="0"
        SVALUE="$TEMP;$HUM;9"

        # Send data
        curl -s -i -H "Accept: application/json" "http://$SERVER/json.htm?type=command&param=udevice&hid=$HID&did=$DID&dunit=$DUNIT&dtype=$DTYPE&dsubtype=$DSUBTYPE&nvalue=$NVALUE&svalue=$SVALUE"
fi
}}}

Following lines needs to be edited to suit your system

 * _*SERVER*_ this should be the address for your Domoticz server
 * The variable _*INDATA*_ should contain the path where the Tempsensor utility is located
